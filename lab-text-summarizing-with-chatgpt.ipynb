        "## Findings\n",
        "- Created 3 prompt versions: general summary, shipping focus, and price/value focus.  \n",
        "- General summaries were mostly accurate, but wording and minor details varied between runs.  \n",
        "- Shipping-focused summaries were very consistent and topic-specific.  \n",
        "- Price/value summaries sometimes included irrelevant information or mixed topics (e.g., shipping mentioned in value summary).  \n",
        "- GPT occasionally “hallucinated” small details or phrasing but preserved main points.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "- Focused extraction prompts produce more reliable and topic-specific summaries.  \n",
        "- Word limits help keep summaries concise.  \n",
        "- Prompt clarity and specifying the topic are essential to reduce errors and improve relevance.  \n",
        "- Minor variations between runs are normal due to model non-determinism, even at low temperature.\n"
